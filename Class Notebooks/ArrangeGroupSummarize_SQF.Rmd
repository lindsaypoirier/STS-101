# Arrange, Group By, Summarize

## Load packages

```{r}
_____(tidyverse)
```

## Import data into R and read into data frame

It may take a few moments for this file to load.

```{r}
#Read in the csv.
sqf_2018 <- read.csv("https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/nypd/downloads/excel/analysis_and_planning/stop-question-frisk/sqf-2016.csv") 
sqf_2018_race_cat <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lindsaypoirier/STS-101/master/Data/SQF/sqf_race_categories.csv") 
```

```{r}
sqf_2018 <- sqf_2018 %>% left_join(sqf_2018_race_cat, by = "race")
```

Added variables for 1) weapon found, 2) arrestsumm, 3) forceused

```{r}
sqf_2018 <- 
  sqf_2018 %>%
  mutate(wpnfound=ifelse((pistol=="Y"|riflshot=="Y"|asltweap=="Y"|knifcuti=="Y"|machgun=="Y"|othrweap=="Y"),"Y","N"))

sqf_2018 <- 
  sqf_2018 %>%
  mutate(arrestsumm=ifelse((sumissue=="Y"|arstmade=="Y"),"Y","N"))

sqf_2018 <- 
  sqf_2018 %>%
  mutate(forceused=ifelse((pf_hands=="Y"|pf_wall=="Y"|pf_grnd=="Y"|pf_drwep=="Y"|pf_ptwep=="Y"|pf_baton=="Y"|pf_hcuff=="Y"|pf_pepsp=="Y"|pf_other=="Y"),"Y","N"))

```
